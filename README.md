# pandastransformers

Some sklearn api conforming transformer objects that (typically) return pandas dataframes.
An example application to the kaggle competition *House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques* will be provided in the future.

Current issues and next steps:
* Rework the Notebook and construct a blog entry. Maybe use an open in sklearn/seaborn contained data set to show how the pipelines work
* Add column selection by pattern
